## The Fesshole Spreadsheet

[The Fesshole Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wiUl3SiU6qlRU50WN1sKZ0ERXXj_7WVvF5QFxTMTAaY/edit#gid=1599891978) is a live document collecting all confession sent by any person
who has access to the form.  That way, confessions can arrive at any given moment any day any time.  
Confessions are all in English since its origin is a twitter account managed presumably from the UK, I believe.

It consists of mainly two columns.  A third column host basic information about the spreadsheet 
on the first three rows.  The first and second columns are the ones with the timestamp and
the text of the confession respectively.

## Importing the Fesshole Spreadsheet

To import it to become part of the analysis we will need to do some rearranging during import.

First we will import the raw spreadsheet as is using the `googlesheets4::read_sheet()` function.  
Authentication to google drive may be required.

The next steps will be commented out to keep the operations as minimum.  An RDS version of the
file will be downloaded and used for analysis.  We can check creation time and modification time
if needed to see if an update is required.

I suggest updating the file if a minimum of 15 days have elapsed since tis creation.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Run this if an updated version of the spreadsheet is needed for analysis
# Save file as RDS in project folder
# Un-comment to update and comment back again
# fesshole_raw <- googlesheets4::read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wiUl3SiU6qlRU50WN1sKZ0ERXXj_7WVvF5QFxTMTAaY/edit#gid=1599891978", col_types = "c"  )

```

```{r}
# Saving raw spreadsheet as rds
# Un-comment when updating spreadsheet 
# Comment back again when saving new updated raw RDS file
# write_rds(fesshole_raw, here::here("data", "data_raw", "fesshole_raw.rds"))

```

Let's check the creation time of the fesshole_raw rds file.

```{r}
rds_created <- file.info(here::here("data", "data_raw", "fesshole_raw.rds"))$ctime
rds_created
```

How many days have elapsed since file creation?

```{r}
round(Sys.time() - rds_created, 0)
```

If the difference is 15 days or more, please update and save as RDS the fesshole_raw file.  

## Revising the raw file

For the revision we will read the RDS file of the fesshole spreadsheet.

```{r}
fesshole_rds <- read_rds(here::here("data", "data_raw", "fesshole_raw.rds"))
```

Let's preview it

```{r}
fesshole_rds %>% 
  head()
```
As indicated previously, the third column shows only general information regarding the confessions and
can be safely removed.  

During the import the column type selected was character thus affecting the timestamp column.  
Timestamp will be reverted back to data using the lubridate function.

We will rename the remaining columns to simplified the variables names and make them consistent.


```{r}
fesshole_new <- fesshole_rds %>% 
  select(Timestamp, `What's your confession?`) %>% 
  rename(confessions = `What's your confession?`,
         timestamp = Timestamp) %>% 
  mutate(timestamp = lubridate::mdy_hms(timestamp))

```

We will visualize a random selection of 5 rows from the data.

```{r}
fesshole_new %>%
  dplyr::sample_n(5)
```

This did not require much data wrangling it seems.  We will save it as an rds version.  
This will be commented out and only needs to be reactivated when updating fesshole_raw.

```{r}
# write_rds(fesshole_new, here::here("data", "fesshole_new.rds"))
```
